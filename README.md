# Data Analysis with Python - Course Labs and Projects

This repository contains all the lab exercises, projects, and notes from the **Data Analysis with Python** course by IBM on the Coursera platform. The course introduces foundational concepts of data analysis, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, model development, and model evaluation using Python and its powerful data science libraries.

## Introduction
This repository demonstrates the application of Python in data analysis through practical labs and mini-projects. Concepts like data wrangling, descriptive statistics, visualization, model development (linear regression, multiple regression, polynomial regression), and model evaluation are covered.

The labs utilize the **Auto Dataset** by **Jeffrey C. Schlimmer**, focusing on understanding relationships between car characteristics (e.g., body style, horsepower, fuel type) and price predictions.

## Course Overview
This project includes completed labs and exercises from the following modules:
1. **Introduction to Data Analysis with Python**  
   - Data import/export, Python packages, understanding data structure.
2. **Data Wrangling**  
   - Preprocessing, dealing with missing values, data formatting, normalization, binning, one-hot encoding.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, ANOVA, visualizations (heatmaps, scatter plots).
4. **Model Development**  
   - Linear regression, multiple regression, polynomial regression, model evaluation, prediction.
5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Model refinement, overfitting/underfitting, ridge regression, grid search, cross-validation.
